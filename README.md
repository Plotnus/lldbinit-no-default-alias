lldbinit-no-default-alias
========
a lldbinit file that removes all default alias.

created to help me learn the native lldb commands that adhere to the
lldb command structure of: 
<noun> <verb> [-options [option-value]] [argument [argument...]]

I believe that learning these commands will help in the future as I
will better know how to navigate help using help's natural hierarchy.

Installing
----------

    chmod +x lldbinit
    cp lldbinit ~/.lldbinit
